# ### Zero Check Decorator

# Write a decorator function called `check` that verifies that the denominator is not equal to 0 and apply it to the following function:

# python
# @check
# def div(a, b):
#    return a / b



# input: div(6, 2)
# output: 3



# input: div(6, 0)
# output: "Denominator can't be zero"

def check(func):
    def wrapper(a, b):
        if b == 0:
            return "Denominator can't be zero"
        return func(a, b)
    return wrapper
@check
def div(a, b):
    return a / b

print(div(6, 2))  # Output: 3.0
print(div(6, 0))

# ### **Employee Records Manager**
# **Objective**: Create a program to manage employee records using file handling.  

# **Tasks**:  
# 1. **File Creation and Data Entry**  
#    - Create a file named **"employees.txt"**.  
#    - Allow the user to add new employee records. Each record should have the following fields:  
     
#      Employee ID, Name, Position, Salary
     
#      Example of a record:  
     
#      1001, John Doe, Software Engineer, 75000
     

# 2. **Menu Options**  
#    Your program should present the following options:  
   
#    1. Add new employee record
#    2. View all employee records
#    3. Search for an employee by Employee ID
#    4. Update an employee's information
#    5. Delete an employee record
#    6. Exit

# Run the menu
menu()
   

# 3. **Functional Requirements**  
#    - **Option 1**: Append a new employee record to **"employees.txt"**.  
#    - **Option 2**: Display all employee records from **"employees.txt"**.  
#    - **Option 3**: Allow the user to search for an employee by **Employee ID** and display their details.  
#    - **Option 4**: Update an employeeâ€™s information (name, position, or salary) based on the Employee ID.  
#    - **Option 5**: Delete an employee's record from the file using the Employee ID.  
#    - **Option 6**: Exit the program.

# ### **Word Frequency Counter**
# **Objective**: Analyze a text file and count how often each word appears.  

# **Tasks**:  
# 1. **File Input**  
#    - Use the file **"sample.txt"**. The file can contain any text (like a paragraph or an article).  
#    - If **"sample.txt"** does not exist, prompt the user to create it by typing in a paragraph.  

# 2. **Count Word Frequency**  
#    - Read the file content and split it into individual words.  
#    - Count the frequency of each word (ignore capitalization, e.g., "The" and "the" should be counted as the same word).  
#    - Ignore punctuation (like commas, periods, etc.).  

# 3. **Output**  
#    - Display the total number of words in the file.  
#    - Display the top 5 most common words with their counts.  
#    - Save the output to a new file called **"word_count_report.txt"**.  

# 4. **Example Output**  
#    **Content of sample.txt**:  
   
#    This is a simple file.
#    This file, is for testing purposes. It is a test file.
   

#    **Console Output**:  
   
#    Total words: 14
#    Top 5 most common words:
#    is - 3 times
#    this - 2 times
#    file - 3 times
#    a - 2 times
#    test - 1 time
   

#    **Content of word_count_report.txt**:  
   
#    Word Count Report
#    Total Words: 14
#    Top 5 Words:
#    is - 3
#    file - 3
#    this - 2
#    a - 2
#    test - 1

except ValueError:
    top_n = 5  # default if invalid input

# Run the counter

# **Bonus Task**:  
# - Allow the user to specify how many "top common words" to display (e.g., top 3, top 10, etc.).  
# - Make sure the program ignores case, punctuation, and handles large files efficiently.
