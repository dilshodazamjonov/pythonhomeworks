# #### Task 1: Create a Library Management System with Custom Exceptions
# 1. Create a Python program to manage a small library system. 
# 2. Define custom exceptions for specific scenarios:
#    - **`BookNotFoundException`**: Raised when trying to borrow a book that doesnâ€™t exist in the library.
#    - **`BookAlreadyBorrowedException`**: Raised when a book is already borrowed.
#    - **`MemberLimitExceededException`**: Raised when a member tries to borrow more books than allowed.
# 3. Implement classes for:
#    - **`Book`**: Attributes include `title`, `author`, and `is_borrowed`.
#    - **`Member`**: Attributes include `name`, `borrowed_books` (limit to 3 books per member).
#    - **`Library`**: Manages books and members, including borrowing and returning books.
# 4. Test your program with the following scenarios:
#    - Adding books and members.
#    - Borrowing and returning books.
#    - Handling exceptions when rules are violated.

# #### Task 2: Student Grades Management
# 1. Create a CSV file named `grades.csv` with the following structure:
   
# csv
#    Name,Subject,Grade
#    Alice,Math,85
#    Bob,Science,78
#    Carol,Math,92
#    Dave,History,74
   

# 2. Write a Python program to:
#    - Read data from `grades.csv` and store it in an appropriate data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries).
#    - Calculate the average grade for each subject.
#    - Write a new CSV file named `average_grades.csv` with the following structure:
     
# csv
#      Subject,Average Grade
#      Math,88.5
#      Science,78
#      History,74
     

# 3. Use the `csv` module for reading and writing the CSV files.


try:
    with open('grades.csv', newline='') as f:
        reader = csv.DictReader(f)
        data = list(reader)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: grades.csv file not found.")
    data = []

# Step 2: Calculate averages

for d in data:
    subject = d['subject']

        grade = int(d['grade'])
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Invalid grade value for subject {subject}: {d['grade']}")
        continue

    if subject not in grade_average:
        grade_average[subject] = {'sum': 0, 'count': 0}

    grade_average[subject]['sum'] += grade
    grade_average[subject]['count'] += 1

averages = {
    subject: (info['sum'] / info['count'])
    for subject, info in grade_average.items()
    if info['count'] > 0
}

# Step 3: Write to average_grades.csv
with open('average_grades.csv', mode='w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Subject", "Average Grade"])
    for sub, avg in averages.items():
        writer.writerow([sub, round(avg, 2)])  # Rounded for neatness

# ### **Task 3: JSON Handling**

# #### **Load and Save Tasks (JSON)**
# 1. Create a JSON file named `tasks.json` with the following structure:
   
# json
#    [
#        {"id": 1, "task": "Do laundry", "completed": false, "priority": 3},
#        {"id": 2, "task": "Buy groceries", "completed": true, "priority": 2},
#        {"id": 3, "task": "Finish homework", "completed": false, "priority": 1}
#    ]
   
# 2. Write a Python program to:
#    - Load the tasks from `tasks.json`.
#    - Display all tasks with the following fields: ID, Task Name, Completed Status, Priority.
#    - Save any changes back to the `tasks.json` file (e.g., after modifying a task).

# #### **Calculate Task Completion Stats**
# 1. Write a Python function to calculate the following statistics:
#    - **Total tasks**: Count the total number of tasks.
#    - **Completed tasks**: Count the number of completed tasks.
#    - **Pending tasks**: Count the number of tasks that are not completed.
#    - **Average priority**: Calculate the average priority level of all tasks.
   
#    Display these statistics after loading the tasks.

# #### **Convert JSON Data to CSV**
# 1. Write a function to convert the task data in `tasks.json` to a CSV file named `tasks.csv`. The CSV should have the following columns:
#    - ID
#    - Task Name
#    - Completed Status
#    - Priority

#    For example:
   
# csv
#    ID,Task,Completed,Priority
#    1,Do laundry,False,3
#    2,Buy groceries,True,2
#    3,Finish homework,False,1
